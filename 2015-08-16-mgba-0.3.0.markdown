A new release of mGBA, version 0.3.0, is available. This is a major feature release. Some of the more prominent features include the addition of support for rotation and tilt sensors on controllers with analog sticks, default controller profiles for some of the more common controllers, improved synchronization, the beginning of the debug suite, and much more. An extensive list follows after the cut.<!--more-->
