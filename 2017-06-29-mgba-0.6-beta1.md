mGBA 0.6.0 has been long delayed. It's dense with new features and unfortunately not all of those features are hugely well-tested. However, it's almost ready for release. Before a stable release, more comprehensive testing is needed. In the getting out what's already working and promoting testing, mGBA 0.6 beta 1 is now available. The final release of mGBA 0.6.0 should be out within a few weeks.<!--more-->

The following features are either new and not very well tested or heavily revamped and in need of more testing. Please focus on these while testing and report any and all bugs on [GitHub](https://mgba.io/i/) or email bugs@mgba.io.

- Game Boy support got some pretty serious changes and may be buggy in some cases.
- The new debugging tools, such as the command-line debugger and the sprite viewer, may be prone to deadlocking or crashing.
- The library view is quite new and not heavily tested yet.
- There are now translations for German and Spanish that are not well reviewed and partially incomplete.
- Performance. The core event timing was rewritten and should be faster, but may be slower in some cases.
