Given the fast pace of development, the fact that there won't be a feature release for several months (or a bugfix release for several weeks), combined with the fact that people are asking for new things that have already been implemented or fixed, has led to me setting up a nightly build process. For those on Windows or OS X, nightly builds are now available from the [Downloads]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads.html) section.
