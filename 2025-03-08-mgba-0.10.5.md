A new release of mGBA, version 0.10.5 is available. This version is a bugfix release, which contains several important fixes.
Though 0.10.4 was scheduled to be the last version before 0.11, some major issues were discovered and fixed.
Important fixes include save state loading leading to a small portion of the ROM getting corrupted until reset, which affected games including Golden Sun, the Wii version (and potentially other versions) crashing when loading from ZIP files that are too large, and another issue with the updater.
As this version only includes important fixes and smaller fixes that are unlikely to cause more issues the list of changes is small.
This will be the last release before 0.11 unless a major issue is discovered, and may be the last release to support Windows 7 – 8.1 and macOS 10.9 – 10.12.
An extensive list of changes follows after the cut.<!--more-->
