While it's been long enough since mGBA 0.6.0 came out that the release of mGBA 0.7.0 has seemed like it may never happen, I'm glad to say we're finally reaching the end of mGBA 0.6's time.
Due to significant life changes, not the least of which is getting a new job with a long, tiring commute, I've not has as much time to do serious feature work. However, there have been plenty of changes, fixes, improvements under the hood.
Though mGBA 0.7.0 is almost ready I'd like to see a signficant wave of testing and bugfixes before I deem it stable. As such, mGBA 0.7 beta 1 is now available, and hopefully the release of mGBA 0.7.0 will be out within a week or two.<!--more-->

This time around the biggest areas of change are not new features, but rather significant improvements in existing areas. Please focus on these while testing and report any and all bugs on [GitHub](https://mgba.io/i/) or email bugs@mgba.io.

- Game Boy audio has been revamped. It may not sound correct in many cases and narrowing down which cases are reliably broken will help fix them.
- New Game Boy peripherals are supported, including the Camera, Printer, and Super Game Boy. Additionally, several new mappers have partial support.
- Debugging tools are improved, including a map viewer, conditional breakpoints, and symbol loading.
- There are now translations for Italian and French that are not well reviewed and partially incomplete.
- Switch support is brand new and very young. It's very likely to be full of bugs.
