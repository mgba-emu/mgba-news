The initial release of mGBA, version 0.1.0, is here! mGBA aims to be a high-quality Game Boy Advance emulator, and I look forward to getting feedback from the community to make it even higher quality in the future.

Get it now in the [Downloads]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads.html) section. Binaries are available for Windows and OS X, and the source code is available for all other platforms.
