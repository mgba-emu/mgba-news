A new release of mGBA, version 0.8.3, is available. This version is a bugfix release, which contains many stability and accuracy fixes. Notably, an issue leading to stuttered rendering and eventually a crash, mostly on AMD GPUs, has been fixed. However, there is an [outstanding bug](https://mgba.io/i/1823) in all 0.8 versions that causes flickering in Advance Wars games. This can be worked around by using a dump of the official BIOS, or using 0.7.3 until it is fixed. An extensive list of changes follows after the cut.<!--more-->
