mGBA now has a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/mgba) to help fund its development. If you enjoy using mGBA or like the articles I write, I encourage you to pledge. The money helps cover costs of server infrastructure and purchases, and allows me to devote more resources to the emulator and articles I write. Thank you for your consideration!
