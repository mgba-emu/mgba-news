A new release of mGBA, version 0.10.4 is available. This version is a bugfix release, which contains several important fixes.
Important fixes include the Wii version being unable to launch in some cases, and an multiple issue with the updater.
If you are running on Windows and have used the installer (instead of the portable version),
you will need to update manually as a bug that prevents the built-in updater from working properly has only been identified and fixed after the release of 0.10.3.
This will be the last release before 0.11 unless a major issue is discovered, and may be the last release to support Windows 7 – 8.1 and macOS 10.9 – 10.12.
An extensive list of changes follows after the cut.<!--more-->
